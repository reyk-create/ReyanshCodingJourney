# Python Cheatsheet

# Print Functions

# What Are They
# It prints what you want it to print 

# Example
# print("Reyansh")

# Variables

# They are letters which you give value to

# x = 1
# print(x) 

# If Statements

# An if statement checks if you have that item

# if x == 1:
#  print(x)
# Elif Statements

# A elif statement checks something to see if its true

# a = 45
# b = 50
# if a > b:
#  print("a is greater than b")
# elif b > a:
#  print("b is actually greater than a") 
# Else Statements

# an else statement just runs when everything before it is false

# a = 45
# b = 50
# if a > b:
#  print("a is greater than b")
# elif a == b:
#  print(a is equal to b")
# else:
#  print("b is greater than a")

# For Loops

# It loops through your list to see if its there or not

# grocery = ("apples","banana", "Melon")
# for i in grocery:
#   print(i)
